**Registration opens on 4 April.**  
Abstract submission for talks closes on **15 May**, but poster submissions remain open until the registration deadline.

Registration costs **£110 for staff** and **£95 for students**, which includes lunch and coffee breaks on all three days. For those attending remotely, the fee is £10.

The meeting spans three days of traditional conference-style talks and discussion sessions. The Scientific Organising Committee (SOC) will select talks to reflect a broad range of topics, with a substantial proportion allocated to early-career researchers. This is a hybrid event, aimed at increasing accessibility for those unable to attend in person. While most talks will be presented on-site, a limited number of remote presentations will be considered upon request. We aim to ensure that everyone who submits an abstract has the opportunity to present—either as a talk or a poster.
