Registration for this meeting is £110 for staff and £95 for students.

The meeting includes 3 days of traditional conference-style talks and discussion sessions. The SOC will select talks with the aim of ensuring that a range of topics are presented, that priority is given to early-career researchers, and that those from under-represented groups in astronomy have an opportunity to present their work. We will host the meeting in hybrid format to make it accessible to those who would otherwise be unable to attend in person. Most talks will be in person, but we will consider requests to present a limited number of talks remotely. We aim to ensure that everyone who submits an abstract will be able to present their work, either as a talk or as a poster.
