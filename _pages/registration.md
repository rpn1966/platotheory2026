Registration opens on 27 August 2025.

Abstract submission for talks is 21 November 2025, but poster submissions remain open until the registration deadline.

Final registration deadline: **12 December 2025**

The following refreshments will be provided on all three days:  <br>
* Tea, coffee and pastries during the morning coffee breaks  <br>
* A buffet lunch  <br>
* Tea, coffee and biscuits during afternoon coffee breaks

The meeting spans three days of talks, poster pop-ups and discussion sessions. The aim of the meeting is to discuss how theoretical work in planet formation and dynamics can help the PLATO mission achieve its scientific objectives. Hence, the Scientific Organising Committee (SOC) will select talks on topics of relevance to PLATO work packages and working groups. We aim for a substantial proportion to be allocated to early-career researchers. We aim to ensure that everyone who submits an abstract has the opportunity to presentâ€”either as a talk or a poster.
<!-- This is a hybrid event, aimed at increasing accessibility for those unable to attend in person. While most talks will be presented on-site, a limited number of remote presentations will be considered upon request.  -->
