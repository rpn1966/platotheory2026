Registration opens on 29 August 2025.

**[Register Here](https://forms.office.com/e/S9bKkz2dTM)**

Abstract submission for talks will close on 21 November 2025, but poster submissions remain open until the registration deadline.

Final registration deadline: **12 December 2025**

The meeting spans three days of talks, poster pop-ups, discussion sessions and parallel sessions devoted to organising activities within work packages and working groups. The main aims of the meeting are to discuss how theoretical work in planet formation and dynamics can help the PLATO mission achieve its scientific objectives, and to provide time for work package and working group members to organise and coordinate their activities. The Scientific Organising Committee (SOC) will select talks with these aims in mind. We aim for a substantial proportion of talks to be allocated to early-career researchers, and to ensure that everyone who submits an abstract has the opportunity to presentâ€”either as a talk or a poster.
<!-- This is a hybrid event, aimed at increasing accessibility for those unable to attend in person. While most talks will be presented on-site, a limited number of remote presentations will be considered upon request.  --> 

<!-- **Abstract submission is now closed**  -->
