The UKI Discs Meeting will be held in the [Zeeman Building](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk//search/623c8859421e6f5928c0c794) at the University of Warwick. Searching "Zeeman Building, Coventry" on Google Maps will get you to the correct location. The university is located on the outskirts of Coventry, about 3 miles to the city centre. The town of Kenilworth is slightly closer (2 miles), but the small county town of Warwick is actually much further away (7 miles).

## Getting Here {#GettingHere}
### *Arriving by train*

Hatfield Station is located just 1.5 miles from the University of Hertfordshire’s de Havilland and College Lane campuses. The station sits on the Great Northern Line, with regular direct services from London Kings Cross, making it easily accessible from central London and surrounding areas.

From Hatfield Station, you can reach the campuses by UNO bus (£3 10–15 minutes) or by taxi/Uber (approximately £8–£12, 5–10 minutes). The main bus routes serving the university are the 614 and 644, which depart from Stop 3 just outside the station and stop directly at both campuses. Services run frequently on weekdays, with slightly reduced schedules during evenings and weekends. For live schedules and ticket info, visit the UNO Bus website.


### *Arriving by (long-distance) coach*

You can travel to the University of Hertfordshire from other parts of the UK by long-distance coach via National Express, which operates services that stop at The Galleria in Hatfield—just a short walk or local bus ride from the university’s College Lane and de Havilland campuses.

### *Arriving by car*

The de Havilland Campus of the University of Hertfordshire is easily accessible by car and well connected to major road networks. It is located in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, just a few minutes from Junction 3 of the A1(M), making it convenient for drivers coming from London, the Midlands, or the North. The A414 and A1001 also provide good local access from nearby towns such as St Albans and Welwyn Garden City.
