The UKI Discs Meeting will take place in [Room N001 of the de Havilland Main Building](https://maps.herts.ac.uk) on the University of Hertfordshire’s de Havilland Campus in Hatfield, Hertfordshire. The university comprises two campuses—College Lane and de Havilland—which are within walking distance of each other and the nearby Galleria shopping centre. A bus also connects the campuses for added convenience.

## Accommodation {#Accommodation} 

Student rooms are available on the de Havilland Campus at the University of Hertfordshire. These are a convenient and affordable option:
- **£75 + VAT** per night (room only)  
- **£90 + VAT** per night (room with breakfast)

Each room includes a wardrobe, desk, and a small ensuite bathroom, with access to a shared kitchen located on each corridor. Photos below show typical rooms and facilities, courtesy of UH Venues.

There are relatively few budget hotel options in Hatfield this year. The nearby Travelodge is charging slightly more than the student rooms. Other local hotels include the Premier Inn (fairly good value but not within easy walking distance) and the Comet Hotel, a luxury option very close to the venue.
