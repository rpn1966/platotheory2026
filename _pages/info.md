## Getting Here {#GettingHere}
### *Arriving by train*
Hatfield Station is located just 1.5 miles from the University of Hertfordshire’s de Havilland and College Lane campuses. The station sits on the Great Northern Line, with regular direct services from London Kings Cross, making it easily accessible from central London and surrounding areas.

From Hatfield Station, you can reach the campuses by UNO bus (£3, 10–15 minutes) or by taxi/Uber (approximately £8–£12, 5–10 minutes). The main bus routes serving the university are the 614 and 644, which depart from Stop 3 just outside the station and stop directly at both campuses. Services run frequently on weekdays, with slightly reduced schedules during evenings and weekends. For live schedules and ticket info, visit the UNO Bus website.

## Local Interest {#Local}
- Hatfield is just 7 miles from <a href='https://www.enjoystalbans.com/things-to-do/'>St Albans</a>, a historic market town with strong Roman and mediaeval roots. Highlights include St Albans Abbey and the Roman ruins of Verulamium. We plan to arrange transport to St Albans for conference groups to enjoy dinner together. 
- Another Hatfield attraction is the <a href='https://hatfield-house.co.uk'>Hatfield House</a>, built by the Cecil family beside the remains of the original Tudor palace, where Mary I and Elizabeth I spent much of their childhoods. The house is surrounded by formal gardens and a large park.
