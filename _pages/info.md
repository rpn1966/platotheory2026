The UKI Discs Meeting will take place in [Room N001 of the de Havilland Main Building](https://maps.herts.ac.uk) on the University of Hertfordshire’s de Havilland Campus in Hatfield, Hertfordshire. The university comprises two campuses—College Lane and de Havilland—which are within walking distance of each other and the nearby Galleria shopping centre. A bus also connects the campuses for added convenience.

## Accommodation {#Accommodation} 

Student rooms are available on the de Havilland Campus at the University of Hertfordshire. These are a convenient and affordable option:
- **£70** per night (room only)  
- **£85** per night (room with breakfast<sup><a href="#breakfast-note">[1]</a></sup>)

Each room includes a wardrobe, desk, and a small ensuite bathroom, with access to a shared kitchen located on each corridor. Photos below show typical rooms and facilities, courtesy of UH Venues.

There are relatively few budget hotel options in Hatfield this year. The nearby Travelodge is charging slightly more than the student rooms. Other local hotels include the Premier Inn (fairly good value but not within easy walking distance) and the Comet Hotel, a luxury option very close to the venue.

## Getting Here {#GettingHere}
### *Arriving by train*
Hatfield Station is located just 1.5 miles from the University of Hertfordshire’s de Havilland and College Lane campuses. The station sits on the Great Northern Line, with regular direct services from London Kings Cross, making it easily accessible from central London and surrounding areas.

From Hatfield Station, you can reach the campuses by UNO bus (£3, 10–15 minutes) or by taxi/Uber (approximately £8–£12, 5–10 minutes). The main bus routes serving the university are the 614 and 644, which depart from Stop 3 just outside the station and stop directly at both campuses. Services run frequently on weekdays, with slightly reduced schedules during evenings and weekends. For live schedules and ticket info, visit the UNO Bus website.

### *Arriving by (long-distance) coach*
You can travel to the University of Hertfordshire from other parts of the UK by long-distance coach via National Express, which operates services that stop at The Galleria in Hatfield—a short walk from the university’s College Lane and de Havilland campuses.

## Local Interest {#Local}
- Hatfield is just 7 miles from St Albans, a historic market town with strong Roman and mediaeval roots. Highlights include St Albans Abbey and the Roman ruins of Verulamium. We plan to arrange transport to St Albans for conference groups to enjoy dinner together. 
- Another Hatfield attraction is the Hatfield House, built by the Cecil family beside the remains of the original Tudor palace, where Mary I and Elizabeth I spent much of their childhoods. The house is surrounded by formal gardens and a large park.
